Vercel features built-in CI/CD that can build Turborepo applications with near-zero configuration. To show you how this works, we can deploy two applications to Vercel in under 5 minutes without ever leaving the command line!

## Prerequisites

- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli)
- A Vercel account (If you don't have one yet, you'll be prompted to create one when you run the CLI for the first time.)
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (Recommended if you don't want to leave your terminal.)
- A GitHub account

## Create a new Turborepo

For demo purposes, let's use the Turborepo starter.

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx create-turbo@latest
cd my-turborepo # or whatever name you used
```

## Create a repository on GitHub

In your new repository, make sure you have a remote to commit your code to.

```bash filename="Terminal"
gh repo create --public --source=. --remote=origin
```

## Link your repository to Vercel

Now that your local repository has a remote on GitHub, you can create projects on Vercel that are connected to your remote using [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).

```bash filename="Terminal"
vercel link --repo
```

This command will create a new file at the root of your repository at `.vercel/repo.json` where you'll find a mapping of your applications to Vercel projects.

## Ship!

You're ready to go! Time to ship your applications.

To ship your `docs` app:

```bash filename="Terminal"
cd apps/docs
vercel
```

To ship your `web` app:

```bash filename="Terminal"
cd apps/web
vercel
```

You've now shipped two preview deployments from one monorepo. You could also choose to run `vercel --prod` to ship to production.

Vercel will use your [Vercel Remote Cache](https://vercel.com/docs/monorepos/remote-caching) with zero-configuration. Through [workspace-level caching](/monorepos/ci-cd-caching), you'll always be shipping as fast as possible.

## Iterate!

To get your local machine hooked up to your [Vercel Remote Cache](https://vercel.com/docs/monorepos/remote-caching#vercel-remote-cache), run two quick commands:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx turbo login
npx turbo link
```

You'll now be sharing tasks across machines, never duplicating work across your local and CI machines.

As you continue building, you can push code to GitHub on branches and pull requests to create new preview deployments and ship code to production. You can also create one-off preview deployments using `vercel` in your terminal to ship your current changes to a Preview Deploy whenever you'd like.
