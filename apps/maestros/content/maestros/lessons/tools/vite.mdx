ogDescription: Using Vite in a monorepo
---

Using Next.js in a monorepo is a great way to give your Next.js applications even more superpowers.

## Want easy mode?

If you prefer, you can [clone the monorepo for Maestros](https://github.com/anthonyshew/maestros.git) (remember to star the repo while you're there!) and use the application found in `apps/starter-nextjs`. Remove any apps you don't want and you're good to go!

## Geting started

## Adding your configurations

### Prettier

### TypeScript

### ESLint

## Using your UI package

### With Tailwind

We like to let the application compile Tailwind classes for us to keep things simple. We've written more about this pattern and why we do it that way on [the Tailwind page](/monorepos/tools/tailwind).
