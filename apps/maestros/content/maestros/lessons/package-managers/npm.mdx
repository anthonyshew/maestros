ogDescription: Using npm in a monorepo

import { FileTree } from '@repo/ui';

[npm](https://npmjs.com) was the first JavaScript package manager, setting the standard for all of the package managers that we have today. npm comes bundled with the Node.js runtime and is the default package manager for the JavaScript ecosystem and supports monorepos through workspaces.

## Setting up workspaces

To create your workspaces, you'll need a `workspaces` field in your `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-repo",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": { ... },
  "devDependencies": { ... },
  // focus(1:2)
  "packageManager": "npm@8.5.0", // Needed for Turborepo
  "workspaces": ["apps/*", "packages/*"]
}
```

Now, any directory in your `apps` and `packages` directories that contains a `package.json` will be treated as a workspace.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
  <FileTree.File name="package-lock.json" />
  <FileTree.Folder name="apps" open>
    <FileTree.File name="docs (Workspace!)" />
    <FileTree.File name="web (Workspace!)" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.Folder name="packages" open>
    <FileTree.File name="logger (Workspace!)" />
    <FileTree.File name="ui (Workspace!)" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

To begin building packages, see [the packaging page](/monorepos/packaging).

To begin building apps, see the [applications page](/monorepos/packaging/applications).

## Tips and tricks

### Workspace-specific commands

Say you want to run an npm command in a specific workspace. This can be done using the `--workspace` argument (`-w` for short). The value is your workspace's name from `package.json`.

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm install react -w @repo/ui
```
