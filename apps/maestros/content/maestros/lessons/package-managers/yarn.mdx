[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) was the second package manager to be made after npm. Yarn introduced many innovations at the time including native monorepo support, caching, and lock files.

The first version of Yarn, now known as Yarn Classic, works similar to npm, installing bundled versions of package source code. But the second version of Yarn introduced a strategy called "Plug 'n' Play" as an effort to reduce installation times and use less desk space compared to `node_modules`.

## Yarn Classic

## Setting up workspaces

To create your workspaces, you'll need a `workspaces` field in your `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "name": "my-repo",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": { ... },
  "devDependencies": { ... },
  // focus(1:2)
  "packageManager": "yarn@1.22.15", // Needed for Turborepo
  "workspaces": ["apps/*", "packages/*"]
}
```

Now, any directory in your `apps` and `packages` directories that contains a `package.json` will be treated as a workspace.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
  <FileTree.File name="package-lock.json" />
  <FileTree.Folder name="apps" open>
    <FileTree.File name="docs (Workspace!)" />
    <FileTree.File name="web (Workspace!)" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.Folder name="packages" open>
    <FileTree.File name="logger (Workspace!)" />
    <FileTree.File name="ui (Workspace!)" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Tips and tricks

### Interact with a specific workspace

You can run Yarn commands on a specific workspace using the `--workspace` command (or `-w`, for short).

```bash filename="Terminal"
yarn add react -w ui
```

This will install React to a workspace with the `"name": "ui"` in its `package.json`.

### Figure out where a package is being installed

Package dependencies trees can be hard to debug. Sometimes, you just want to figure out what a package is in your repository in the first place.

```bash filename="Terminal"
yarn why react
```

This command will show you everywhere in your dependency tree where `react` is being brought in and why.
