import { FileTree, Callout } from '@repo/ui';

In the root of your project, there is a minimal set of files that you must have to make sure things work correctly.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.File name=".gitignore" />
  <FileTree.File name="turbo.json" />
  <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
  <FileTree.File name="pnpm-lock.yaml" />
  <FileTree.File name="pnpm-workspace.yaml" />
</FileTree>

### .gitignore

A `.gitignore` file isn't unique to a monorepo but it's still essential to have. There will be many files that we create while we're working locally that don't belong in source control. A minimally effective `.gitignore` may look like:

```js filename=".gitignore" note="Make sure you add any directories or files you may need for your project."
# dependencies
node_modules
.pnp
.pnp.js

# testing
coverage

# next.js
.next/
out/
build

# misc
.DS_Store
*.pem

# debug
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# local env files
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# turbo
.turbo
```

### turbo.json

This file is responsible for setting up the tasks that we will run in our monorepo. It will define tasks into "pipelines," ensuring that we create a certain order with our tasks so things run correctly (and fast). A minimal `turbo.json` with a build task for Next.js applications looks like:

```json filename="turbo.json"
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": [".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"]
    }
  }
}
```

We'll talk more about this file when we make it to [monorepo managers](/monorepos/managers) but for right now, all we want to remember is: **This file is responsible for conducting the symphony.**

### package.json

This is the absolute home of our repository, where it all starts. In our root `package.json`, we'll do a number of important things:

- Install our monorepo manager
- Create default scripts for easy access
- Define the package manager for the repository

```json filename="package.json" note="We're using pnpm for the sake of demonstration. You can use your favorite."
{
  "name": "my-repo",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    // ...
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "turbo": "latest"
  },
  "packageManager": "pnpm@8.0.0"
}
```

### A lockfile

We'll also need a lockfile for our package manager. The lockfile is responsible for ensuring that the same dependencies are installed whenever someone uses our monorepo.

If we don't have a lockfile, it would be possible to install different dependencies across developers and CI machines, leading to unexpected behavior. When we commit our lockfile to source control, we'll know that everyone is going to be using the same dependencies so we'll have a more stable system.

### Workspace definition file

<Callout type="warning">
  We only need this file when we are using pnpm. npm and Yarn define their
  workspaces in your root package.json instead. We'll discuss these nuances
  further in the section on package managers.
</Callout>

For pnpm monorepos, we need to create a file to tell pnpm where our workspaces are located. If you're using the usual monorepo structure with `apps` and `packages`, it will look like:

```yml filename="pnpm-workspace.yml"
packages:
  - apps/*
  - packages/*
```

## Moving out to workspaces

With the root of the repository handled, we can move out to [creating workspaces](/monorepos/basics/workspaces) to start building the more active parts of our codebase.
