Internal Packages are similar to [External Packages](/monorepos/packaging) in many ways:

- Compiled: The package is compiled from its source code.
- Specified entrypoint(s): The package has explicit places for you to access the functionality that the package provides.
- Package manager-friendly: Installing packages with your package manager is an easy way to share code.

However, Internal Packages are different in two important ways:

- In-repo source code: The code that makes up the package is in your repository, making it highly discoverable, accessible, and editable.
- One version: When installing to other workspaces within your repository, you'll use `"*"` (or `"workspace:*"` for pnpm). This means you'll always use whatever the current version of the code that is in your repository.

When you compile a package in your Turborepo, you can cache your compilation outputs for sub-second build times. Build your source code once; never build it again.

Let's take a look at what it takes to build an Internal Package for UI component library with React and TypeScript.

## Create a workspace

We first need to lay the foundation for our workspace. We can do so in a few quick steps.

### Make sure our package manager sees the workspace

Establish a workspace by following [the workspace instructions for your package manager](/monorepos/package-managers).

### Add our `tsconfig.json`

We'll be making a TypeScript package so we need to have a `tsconfig.json`. If you've read [the Typescript reference](/monorepos/guardrails/typescript) already, this will look familiar:

```json filename="packages/ui/tsconfig.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig",
  "extends": "@repo/tsconfig/react-library.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "tsBuildInfoFile": "node_modules/.cache/tsbuildinfo.json",
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "include": ["."],
  "exclude": ["dist", "node_modules"]
}
```

There are a few important properties that you'll want to make sure you include in either your base `tsconfig` or here in your package's `tsconfig.json` to have the smoothest experience:

- `"declaration": true`: Create `.d.ts` files for your compiled JavaScript so your package has types when imported by other workspaces.
- `"declarationMap": true`: Generates maps between your type declarations and JavaScript files. This allows your editor to jump to the source code rather than your `.d.ts` file when you use Go To Definition.
- `"outDir": "dist"`: The location where your TypeScript declaration files will be created. You want this to be the same as where your .

All of these configurations will add up to a perfect TypeScript experience once we get to our compilation step.

### Add a `package.json`

Create a `package.json` in your workspace directory. We'll fill in `"exports"` and `"scripts"` step-by-step later so we can understand what they do, piece-by-piece.

```json filename="packages/ui/package.json"
{
  "name": "@repo/ui",
  "version": "0.1.0", // Arbitrary for Internal Packages
  "private": true, // Prevents npm publishing
  "exports": {}, // Entrypoints for your application
  "scripts": {}, // Tasks for the package
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@repo/tsconfig": "workspace:*",
    "@types/react": "^18.2.20",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "tsup": "^7.2.0", // Bundler for compilation
    "typescript": "^5.1.6"
  }
}
```

At this point, hit the install command for your package manager to get the packages installed.

## Create some source code

We'll use an `src` folder in our workspace to keep things tidy. Create your first UI component in an index file:

```tsx filename="packages/ui/src/index.tsx"
export const Button = (props: { text: string }) => {
  return <button>{props.text}</button>;
};
```

## Prepare for compilation

We'll need to get our TypeScript compiled to JavaScript so our applications and packages can consume our code. For this, we like to use [`tsup`](https://tsup.egoist.dev), a bundler that gives us a simple yet powerful bundling API with `esbuild` under the hood.

### Make a `tsup` configuration file

We want to be able to compile our package the same way whether we are building in watch mode for development or building for production. `tsup` can read from a `tsup.config.js` file to give us a consistent configuration to use:

```js filename="packages/ui/tsup.config.js" note="We're using JavaScript here but will still get great autocomplete. ðŸ˜„"
import { defineConfig } from 'tsup';
import { exec } from 'child_process';

export default defineConfig((options) => ({
  entry: ['src/index.tsx'], // Where your source code lives (can provide multiple entries)
  splitting: false,
  treeshake: true,
  clean: true,
  outDir: 'dist', // Where you want your compiled files to live
  onSuccess: async () => {
    exec('tsc --emitDeclarationOnly');
  },
  ...options,
}));
```

Notice the important `onSuccess` function here. It's responsible for giving us TypeScript declaration files so that our editor will jump to our TypeScript source code instead of our compiled JavaScript. [tsup is unable to generate these files](https://tsup.egoist.dev/#generate-typescript-declaration-maps--d-ts-map) but, luckily, the TypeScript compiler handles these pretty quickly.

### Make a build and dev script

Head back to your `package.json` and add some scripts:

```json filename="packages/ui/package.json"
{
  "name": "@repo/ui",
  "version": "0.1.0", // Arbitrary for Internal Packages
  "private": true, // Prevents npm publishing
  "exports": {}, // Entry points for your application
    // focus(1:4)
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsup",
    "dev": "tsup --watch"
  },
  "dependencies": {...},
  "devDependencies": {...}
}
```

### Ensure your dist will be gitignored

You'll want to make sure you aren't committing your builds to source control. If you haven't done so yet, add `dist` to your `.gitignore`:

## Set up your exports

`exports` is where we define the entry points to our package. Workspaces that consume your Internal Package will use these as the places that they can import code from.

To create the entrypoint, we'll fill in the `"exports"` field of the `package.json`:

```json filename="packages/ui/package.json"
{
  "name": "@repo/ui",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
    // focus(1:6)
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
      "import": "./dist/index.js"
    }
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsup",
    "dev": "tsup -w"
  },
  "dependencies": {...},
  "devDependencies": {...}
}
```

## Compile your code

We should be ready now! Run `turbo build --filter=ui` in your terminal and check your new `ui` package to find a `dist` folder full of `.d.ts` and `.js` files.

We'll now be able to import our code in an application once we install it to its workspace:

```ts filename="apps/web/src/index.ts"
import { Button } from '@repo/ui';
```

## Iteration speed: Unlocked

You'll now be able to continually update this package much faster than if you needed to publish it to npm since it will be right there alongside the rest of the code for your applications. If you, for example, change a TypeScript interface in your UI package, you'll instantly be able to find any mistypings in your application the next time you run `turbo typecheck`.

If you'd like to build conformance into your new UI package, be sure to follow along with the references in [the Guardrails pages](/monorepos/guardrails).
