ogDescription: Setting up TypeScript in your monorepo.

import { FileTree, Callout } from '@repo/ui';

Handling TypeScript in a monorepo can be daunting at first. If you set it up wrong, you can end up frustrated with errors that don't make sense and slow type checking scripts.

But, once you've learned to hold the TypeScript violin just right, the type checking in your repo will be fast and you can iterate safely.

Let's build a simple TypeScript package to find out how this works.

## Create a workspace for a common `tsconfig.json`

First, we'll build a TSConfig that will be the base for all the TypeScript code in our repository. We'll always extend off of this base to reduce duplication and know we're working with the right set of defaults every time.

Create a workspace in your `tooling` directory (or `packages`, whatever you prefer). We'll add a `package.json` that exports a `base.json` file:

```json filename="tooling/tsconfig/package.json" lang="json"
{
  // focus(1:1)
  "name": "@repo/tsconfig",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  // focus(1:1)
  "files": ["base.json"]
}
```

Note that we don't need to install TypeScript (or anything else!) in this package's dependencies. All we need is a `base.json` TSConfig like this one:

```json filename="tooling/tsconfig/base.json" lang="json"
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig", // For in-editor Intellisense
  "display": "Default",
  "compilerOptions": {
    // focus(1:3)
    "incremental": true, // Must have for next steps!
    "skipLibCheck": true, // Highly recommended!
    "strict": true, // Highly recommended!
    "composite": false,
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationMap": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "inlineSources": false,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "moduleResolution": "Node16",
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": false,
    "noUnusedParameters": false,
    "preserveWatchOutput": true
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

The TSConfig above has the usual defaults for most projects so feel free to copy-paste. It contains many optional properties that you can tailor it to your liking but, at the very least, make sure you keep:

- `"strict": true` so the compiler finds as many mistakes as possible
- `"skipLibCheck": true` so only the source code in your workspace is checked by the task
- `"incremental": true` for faster type checking (which we will discuss in a moment)

## Make the TypeScript compiler fast in a monorepo

There are three strategies that we will use to make `tsc` fast:

1.  `incremental` saves information about your project compilation into a file. The first time you run `tsc`, the compiler will create this file to make subsequent runs faster.
2.  Parallelizing the type checking scripts in our workspaces.
3.  Caching workspace tasks with our package manager so that we can ensure we never do the same work twice.

Putting these techniques together, we'll be caching the type check task for entire workspaces so we hit cache for work we've already done **and** be as fast as possible when we miss the cache to check types.

### Set up a TypeScript workspace

Let's start by handling the `package.json` for our workspace. We'll need to install:

1.  `typescript`
2.  `@repo/tsconfig`, the package with our base TSConfig.

After that we'll create a script for running `tsc` with the `--noEmit` flag so that the compiler _only_ checks types, skipping out on the actual compilation work.

```json filename="packages/logger/package.json" lang="json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@repo/tsconfig": "workspace:*" // Use "*" for npm or yarn
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "5.1.6"
  }
}
```

Next, we'll create a `tsconfig.json` in our workspace where we'll extend from our base configuration:

```json filename="packages/logger/tsconfig.json" lang="json"
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/tsconfig",
  // focus(1:4)
  "extends": "@repo/tsconfig/base.json", // Using our base config!
  "compilerOptions": {
    "tsBuildInfoFile": "node_modules/.cache/tsbuildinfo.json"
  },
  "include": ["."],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

Most of this file probably looks familiar. We're extending from our base TSConfig - but what's this `tsBuildInfoFile` property?

`tsBuildInfoFile` tells the TypeScript compiler where to store the output of `incremental`. We're going to use the `.cache` folder in `node_modules` as this is a common practice for storing caches for libraries and dependencies.

Test it out! (Using [globally installed `turbo`](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/installing#install-globally) for simplicity here)

```sh filename="Terminal"
cd packages/logger
turbo typecheck
```

If all goes according to plan, you'll see your task ran by Turborepo in your terminal and a `tsbuildinfo.json` file in the `node_modules/.cache` directory of your workspace.

### Build a Turborepo pipeline

Now, we'll build our Turborepo pipeline with two important characteristics.

```json filename="turbo.json" lang="json"
{
  "pipeline": {
    "topo": {
      "dependsOn": ["^topo"]
    },
    "typecheck": {
      "dependsOn": ["^topo"],
      "outputs": ["node_modules/.cache/tsbuildinfo.json"]
    }
  }
}
```

- **Recursively depending on `topo`**: This is [a little trick from the Turborepo documentation](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/task-dependencies#dependencies-outside-of-a-task). In short, this `dependsOn` pattern flattens your task graph so that everything runs in parallel while still respecting changes in workspace dependencies. (If that sounds confusing, don't worry about it for now; just trust that it works. We'll be writing up a doc for this but, for the time being, let it be magic.) ✨
- **Caching the output of `incremental`**: In the event that our task misses cache, we will still have the `tsbuildinfo.json` to use to speed up our task. Caching this file as a Turborepo `output` ensures that we have the `tsbuildinfo.json` shared across our machines as often as possible so we can use it in as many places as we can.

With these two optimizations, we've massively sped up the type checking task in your repository. We also have a base TSConfig that we will always use so our repository has uniformity that we can trust between individuals and teams.

Congratulations, you are now friends with TypeScript.

    You can create multiple files in your TSConfig workspace to extend from. You
    may want to do this if you have specific needs (for instance, a certain
    framework requires certain options). If you do create multiple files, you
    may still find it advantageous to extend from a common base configuration in
    those custom configurations..

    You'll notice I didn't mention TypeScript's Project References. In a
    Turborepo, you can usually avoid them. 😁
