ogDescription: Setting up ESLint in a monorepo.

import { FileTree, Callout } from '@repo/ui';

ESLint is the most common linter used in the JavaScript world today. Setting it up in a monorepo can be difficult and piecing together the various configurations can be frustrating if you don't know what you need to do.

But we're maestros! We can do this. Let's take a look at how to happily set up ESLint for JavaScript monorepo success.

## Setting up ESLint

As we head into getting ESLint set up, let's remember our requirements for conducting a monorepo symphony:

- We want our workspaces to be as self-contained as possible.
- We want our workspace tasks to happen _within_ our workspaces.
- We want to encourage standardization across the entirety of our monorepo while still allowing for flexibility in workspaces when needed.

### Creating presets

To create some presets for our workspaces, we'll set up a workspace with our configurations in `tooling/eslint-config`.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="tooling" open>
    <FileTree.Folder name="eslint-config" open>
      <FileTree.File name=".eslintrc.js" />
      <FileTree.File name="next.js" />
      <FileTree.File name="node.js" />
      <FileTree.File name="svelte.js" />
      <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Our `package.json` will be relatively simple, installing `eslint` and exporting the files where we'll keep our presets.

```json filename="tooling/eslint-config/package.json" lang="json"
{
  // focus(1:1)
  "name": "@repo/lint",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  // focus(1:1)
  "files": ["node.js", "next.js", "svelte.js"],
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint ."
  },
  // focus(1:3)
  "dependencies": {
    "@next/eslint-plugin-next": "latest", // We'll need this for the Next.js config in a moment.
    "eslint": "^8.40.0"
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  The `lint` script in `package.json` is for linting the `eslint-config`
  workspace itself. It is not the script that runs in your other workspaces.
</Callout>

It's typical that not all of our workspaces will use the exact same linting configuration. As an example, default exports tend to be inadvisable for JavaScript modules but some frameworks require default exports to work properly (e.g. A Next.js `page.js` file needs a default export). We can account for this by creating multiple base configurations.

We'll create a `node.js` file for simple Node apps:

```js filename="tooling/eslint-config/node.js" lang="js"
module.exports = {
  ignorePatterns: ['node_modules/', '**/.eslintrc.js', 'dist/'],
  root: true,
};
```

And another one to use in our Next.js apps:

```js filename="tooling/eslint-config/next.js" lang="js"
const { rules } = require('./utils/rules');

module.exports = {
  extends: ['next'],
  ignorePatterns: ['**/.next/**', '**/.eslintrc.js'],
  root: true,
};
```

### Adding presets to workspaces

Now, we'll want to use these presets out in a workspace. To do so, we'll need to do two things:

1. Create a `.eslintrc.js` file in the workspace.

```js filename="packages/logger/.eslintrc.js" lang="js"
/** @type {import("eslint").Linter.Config} */
module.exports = {
  extends: [require.resolve('@repo/lint/node')], // Installed in next step
  root: true, // Very important!
};
```

Note the `root: true` property! This tells ESLint that it does NOT need to look outside of your workspace for more ESLint configuration files.

2. Install our `@repo/lint` package to the workspace and create a lint script.

```json filename="packages/logger/package.json" lang="js"
{
  "name": "@repo/logger",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    // focus(1:1)
    "lint": "eslint ."
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // focus(1:2)
    "@repo/lint": "workspace:*",
    "eslint": "^8.42.0"
  }
}
```

### Overriding rules in a workspace

To build off of our presets for any specific needs in a particular workspace, you can leverage the `overrides` property of ESLint. It may look something like this:

```js filename="packages/ui/.eslintrc.js" lang="js"
module.exports = {
  extends: [require.resolve("@repo/lint/node")]
  root: true,
  // focus(1:3)
  overrides: [
    // Your overrides here.
  ],
};
```

## Write a pipeline

Once we've created our linting scripts in any workspaces that we want to lint, it's time to build up our Turborepo pipeline.

```json filename="turbo.json" lang="json"
{
  "pipeline": {
    "topo": {
      "dependsOn": ["^topo"]
    },
    "lint": {
      "outputs": ["node_modules/.cache/.eslintcache"],
      "dependsOn": ["^topo"]
    }
  }
}
```

- **Recursively depending on `topo`**: This is [a little trick from the Turborepo documentation](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/task-dependencies#dependencies-outside-of-a-task). In short, this `dependsOn` pattern flattens your task graph so that everything runs in parallel while still respecting changes in workspace dependencies. (If that sounds confusing, don't worry about it for now; just trust that it works. We'll be writing up a doc for this but, for the time being, let it be magic.) ✨
- **Using ESLint caching**: We're about to create an `.eslintcache` file in our workspaces in the next step. In the event that our task misses cache, we will still have the `.eslintcache` to use to speed up our task. Caching this file as a Turborepo `output` ensures that we have the `.eslintcache` shared across our machines as often as possible so we can use it in as many places as we can.

## Run our lint tasks

With all of that ready to go, we're now ready to run our tasks!

In the root of our monorepo, we will create these scripts:

```json filename="package.json" lang="json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "turbo lint --continue -- --cache --cache-location 'node_modules/.cache/.eslintcache'",
    "lint:fix": "turbo lint --continue -- --fix --cache --cache-location 'node_modules/.cache/.eslintcache'"
  }
}
```

Run `pnpm lint`! On the first run, the command will create caches in each workspace both at the ESLint and Turborepo layers.

- Running `pnpm lint` (without changing any code) will give you a `>>> FULL TURBO`. Awesome!
- Changing some code in one workspace will hit cache for all your workspaces except that specific one. That workspace will use the ESLint cache file at `node_modules/.cache/.eslintcache` to lint as fast as possible.
- You now run your `pnpm lint:fix` command to see if ESLint can find any auto-fixable problems.

### Breaking down the script

There are a few key parts to this script. Breaking it down piece by piece:

- `turbo`: Use Turborepo to run the tasks.
- `lint`: The task name to run in your workspaces.
- `--contine`: A Turborepo flag to continue running tasks even if one fails.
- `--`: Passes any flags after it to the underlying child scripts.
- `--cache`: Tells ESLint to use a cache file when running.
- `--cache-location`: Tells ESLint where the cache file is on your file system.

With this all in place, you can run your linting tasks with incredible speed.
