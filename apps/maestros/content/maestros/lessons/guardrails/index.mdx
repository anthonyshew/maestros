import { Callout } from '@repo/ui';

An important part of creating a great monorepo is ensuring that you build safeguards for your developers. Formatters, linters, and type checkers help all developers in a repository work as quickly as possible by paving happy paths throughout your repository.

When we build guardrails correctly, we'll have rules that allow us to do our best work **without blocking progress**. Our goal is to improve velocity, not build annoying roadblocks.

We'll use a combination of tools to make this happen, integrating these tools with our local environment and CI pipelines.

<Callout type="goodToKnow">
  Yes, there are other tools out there for these purposes. The three shown below
  are by far the most common. In the future, we'd love to explore other
  formatting and linting tooling.
</Callout>

## ESLint for linting

**Note that a linter is for verifying and correcting logic, names, and potential bugs in your code.** By statically analyzing certain characteristics of your code, a linter should be able to keep you working smoothly.

We'll use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for this since its the most common tool for linting in the JavaScript world.

## Prettier for formatting

**Note that a formatter is specifically for formatting, not code quality.** It will handle simple things like whitespace, semi-colons, and dangling commas. It should run quickly and not be concerned with code logic or naming conventions.

The most common formatter in the JavaScript ecosystem is [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) so we'll use that.

## TypeScript for type checking

**Note that a type checker is for ensuring that data used in your code is of a specific "type". A type checker is not responsible for whitespace, stylistic, or "taste" decisions.**

Anthony's personal opinion incoming: TypeScript is a must-have for any JavaScript-based project today. You'll see pure JavaScript sprinkled throughout Monorepo Maestros but we will **always overwhelmingly** favor TypeScript for our monorepos.
