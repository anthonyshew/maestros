summary: A shortlist of the tooling I used to make my site.
---

- [Next.js 13 App Router](https://nextjs.org)
  - There's a lot of static content to my portfolio so things in this app aren't too complex (yet?). But I love the way that the App Router works as far as organizing my code and the mental model I get to build.
- [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev)
  - This tool makes it so that you get strongly typed MDX. Something I've always felt was a shortcoming of MDX was that I could break my code by not meeting the format that it's expecting with missing frontmatter in my Markdown files. Contentlayer adds some guardrails to make it so I am forced to get it right.
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - Ya know it, ya love it, ya code it. I know there's a lot of discord out there about React and frontend frameworks but I'm not very opinionated. I like shipping. The first thing I learned was React and I've sort of just kept shipping with it over the years.
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)
  - I didn't hop on the Tailwind train for a long time. Now I won't ever build anything without it. See previous point about shipping.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
  - Stay (type)safe, folks. I'm honestly not sure I could write pure JavaScript anymore.
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
  - I like getting the dependencies into my projects faster. `pnpm` was a revelation for me. Every time I hop back into `npm` and `yarn` projects, I instantly yearn to get back to `pnpm`. A true gamechanger.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
  - Deploying webscale frontends is a solved problem. One day, I'll take the deep dive into building a Frankenstein infrastructure just for fun. But if I'm looking for shipping velocity, I'm using Vercel.
- [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev)
  - I had never used this icon set before! I quite like it!
- [React Wrap Balancer](https://react-wrap-balancer.vercel.app)
  - This is a small but powerful library from a developer that I have massive respect for, [Shu Ding](https://). It ensures that blocks of text (commonly headers) are broken up with similar length when they have to be split on different lines.
- [@vercel/og](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/og)
  - Dynamically generate OpenGraph images at the edge. This makes it so that I don't have to create an OG image for my pages. Instead, they will be generated with code.
- [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes)
  - Handling light mode/dark mode! Sets to your system by default but let's you use the switcher in the top right if you want to change things up.

_But, Anthony, what about all the dependencies of dependencies of dependencies that you're not listing here?_

Yeah, yeah, I know. This is mostly a list of the big stuff and a few new things that I enjoyed playing with.
