    "content": "- [Next.js 13 App Router](https://nextjs.org)\n  - There's a lot of static content to my portfolio so things in this app aren't too complex (yet?). But I love the way that the App Router works as far as organizing my code and the mental model I get to build.\n- [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev)\n  - This tool makes it so that you get strongly typed MDX. Something I've always felt was a shortcoming of MDX was that I could break my code by not meeting the format that it's expecting with missing frontmatter in my Markdown files. Contentlayer adds some guardrails to make it so I am forced to get it right.\n- [React](https://reactjs.org)\n  - Ya know it, ya love it, ya code it. I know there's a lot of discord out there about React and frontend frameworks but I'm not very opinionated. I like shipping. The first thing I learned was React and I've sort of just kept shipping with it over the years.\n- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)\n  - I didn't hop on the Tailwind train for a long time. Now I won't ever build anything without it. See previous point about shipping.\n- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)\n  - Stay (type)safe, folks. I'm honestly not sure I could write pure JavaScript anymore.\n- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)\n  - I like getting the dependencies into my projects faster. `pnpm` was a revelation for me. Every time I hop back into `npm` and `yarn` projects, I instantly yearn to get back to `pnpm`. A true gamechanger.\n- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)\n  - Deploying webscale frontends is a solved problem. One day, I'll take the deep dive into building a Frankenstein infrastructure just for fun. But if I'm looking for shipping velocity, I'm using Vercel.\n- [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev)\n  - I had never used this icon set before! I quite like it!\n- [React Wrap Balancer](https://react-wrap-balancer.vercel.app)\n  - This is a small but powerful library from a developer that I have massive respect for, [Shu Ding](https://). It ensures that blocks of text (commonly headers) are broken up with similar length when they have to be split on different lines.\n- [@vercel/og](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/og)\n  - Dynamically generate OpenGraph images at the edge. This makes it so that I don't have to create an OG image for my pages. Instead, they will be generated with code.\n- [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes)\n  - Handling light mode/dark mode! Sets to your system by default but let's you use the switcher in the top right if you want to change things up.\n\n_But, Anthony, what about all the dependencies of dependencies of dependencies that you're not listing here?_\n\nYeah, yeah, I know. This is mostly a list of the big stuff and a few new things that I enjoyed playing with.",

    "date": "2023-2-16",
    "summary": "After 7 years of being a web developer, I finally got around to making a personal site. Here's my developer story.",
    "content": "Usually, making a portfolio page or personal site is one of the first things that a new web developer does. You can make it as simple as you want and it's really great for learning the basics. HTML, CSS, and _maybe_ a few lines of JavaScript.\n\nNow that I'm seven years in, I'm **finally** getting around to making one myself.\n\n_Maybe I'm still a beginner after all this time? That would explain a lot..._\n\nAnyway, here's my Developer Story.\n\n## \"Welcome to The Show\"\n\nEver since I was 3 years old, this is the only thing that I've ever wanted someone to say to me. **The Show** is a phrase that baseball players use to lovingly refer to Major League Baseball, where the best baseball in the world gets played.\n\nI played baseball my whole young life and was fortunate enough to get to play in college at the University of San Francisco. I also got to play professional baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals. Yes, this is a part of my developer story; stay with me, folks.\n\n<Img\n  src=\"/images/anthony-doing-baseball.jpeg\"\n  alt=\"A picture of me playing baseball in AA. I'm mid-delivery of a fastball at our home stadium in Springfield, Missouri.\"\n  width={3000}\n  height={2400}\n/>\n\nThe picture above is when I was in AA. If you're not familiar with how professional baseball works, it's a lot like levels in a video game. You sign a contract, start at Level 1, and get paid $3,000 for your first year of work. If you get through all the levels, the final boss (Level 6) is playing for millions of dollars on TV.\n\nIf you were reading closely, you might have caught an interesting tidbit there: **As a professional baseball player, I received $3,000 for my first year of work.** Yes, **year**.\n\nAs a matter of fact, **the average salary for 80% of professional baseball players is right around $5,000 per year**. For those of you in the crowd aware of the \"massive signing bonuses\" that are supposed to cover the gap, a livable signing bonus only goes to about 2% of players.\n\n## \"Uh...I've got bills to pay?\"\n\nThat's the price to chase your childhood dream and, as players, we tend to (begrudgingly) accept it. Playing in The Big Leagues isn't the most important thing to us. It's **the only** thing. We know we're making a high-risk, high-reward investment of our time, effort, and health.\n\nBut, in the meantime, we need to eat. I'd just finished college so I had _massive_ debt to cover there. I like living in a house, in the general sense. Food is also pretty cool. I had to figure out a way to pick up some extra coins.\n\n## \"I need a job...?\"\n\nAs you'd imagine, playing pro baseball is a pretty demanding line of work. It doesn't exactly leave room for more employment.\n\nEvery day that you see a game on the schedule below is around 12 hours spent at the stadium. The gray boxes mean travelling to a different city. The pale, blue boxes are days off (that probably were used for travel).\n\n<Img\n  src=\"/images/baseball-schedule.png\"\n  alt=\"A baseball schedule for the Los Angeles Dodgers for the month of April. There are two off days and six different cities listed.\"\n  width={3200}\n  height={2218}\n/>\n\nDuring the offseason, you:\n\n- train about 6 hours a day\n- spend time with loved ones that you don't see during season\n- do your best to get proper rest for the grueling season ahead\n- generally give your brain a rest from the insanity of a baseball season\n\nThat's all to say: My personal requirements for finding a part-time job were pretty stiff and unique. Even if I wanted to try to \"get a real job\" during the offseason, I can only participate there for 4-5 months and then have to disappear for season again.\n\n## \"Remote work solves this\"\n\nI had to find work that could travel with me and let me create the workload that I needed so freelance was a natural fit. I started browsing job boards.\n\nI was seeing postings for web development and they interested me, despite having no idea how it worked. In college, I wanted to take mechanical engineering courses but couldn't because of time constraints. Maybe this is the opportunity to let my inner engineering-ish mind out to do some work?\n\n## \"Let's see about learning this programming thing\"\n\nI Googled something to the effect of \"learn web development free\" and eventually landed at [freecodecamp.org](freedcodecamp.org).\n\n<Img\n  src=\"/images/freecodecamp-homepage.png\"\n  alt=\"A screengrab of the freedcodecamp.org homepage.\"\n  width={3024}\n  height={1732}\n/>\n\nI did a few of the HTML modules and was instantly hooked. Even while I was at the stadium doing baseball work, all I could think about was \"This CSS thing is so dumb; why can't I nest stuff?\"\n\nAfter about two and a half months, I had done all of the modules through React and Express. I had all of the misplaced confidence in the world that I knew how to build full-stack web applications after a couple months of practicing.\n\n## I was wrong but, also, I was right 😎\n\nI started putting in bids to web development contracts, focusing in on projects that catered to my niche: baseball. I had a pretty easy differentiator that I put at the top of all of my proposals:\n\n\"Hi, my name is Anthony and I play professional baseball. [Here is my profile on milb.com](https://www.milb.com/player/anthony-shew-670651). Anyway, I'm also a web developer...\"\n\nThat got nearly everyone's attention. It was a little bit of a cheat code, I'm afraid to admit, considering my actual programming skills. But my bank account was starting to get to uncomfortable levels.\n\nI am happy to report that I did a lot of learning on the job. My clients gave me requirements and I didn't care if I knew how to meet them or not. **I was going to fulfill the contract no matter what.** I never missed a deadline, my clients loved my work enough to start sending me referrals, and I was making the money that I needed to fuel my baseball career.\n\n## Things were going great...\n\nBoth my programming and baseball careers were doing what I wanted. I spent about three years hand-picking contracts for my mini-agency and had gotten promoted enough times to earn my way up to AAA, the boss level before the final boss (MLB).\n\nI had played in two games and, looking back at things, they were near flawless for what I was probably capable of. I had earned my coaches' and teammates' respect and I thought there might be a small chance that I might finally get to hear that sacred sentence this year: **\"Welcome to The Show.\"**\n\n## ...and then disaster struck\n\nIn my third game, though, my career ended (even if I didn't know it at the time).\n\nIf you're not familiar, on a baseball field, a pitcher stands 60 feet (18.2m) away from home plate, where a batter swings and hits a ball back out into the field of play. If a batter really gets a good hold of the ball on a swing, the ball can reach speeds of 100+ mph (160 kph).\n\n<Img\n  src=\"/images/hitter-perspective.png\"\n  alt=\"A baseball hitter making contact with a baseball from the view of an umpire. The ball appears to be going directly back at the pitcher.\"\n  width={3200}\n  height={2218}\n/>\n\nI made a bad pitch and the hitter managed to hit the ball 115 mph (185 kph) directly back at my forehead. Standing about 60 feet away, I had [less than .4s](https://projects.seattletimes.com/2017/mariners-preview/science/) to react and, well, not risk death. Pitchers get hit in the head like this several times a year in the MLB and it's life threatening nearly every time.\n\nThankfully, I'm sitting here writing this blog post, very much alive. However, I caught the ball with the inside of my throwing arm, destroying my ulnar nerve—what you probably call your \"funny bone.\" I wasn't able to feel half of my hand for about two weeks and was getting mysterious tingling, pain sensations randomly. I ended up having to get surgery to fix it.\n\n## Moving on from baseball\n\nThat moment ended my 2019 season and then the 2020 season was cancelled by COVID. Through those two years without a baseball season, I had picked up _tons_ of web development work and was slowly learning that I was never going to be able to throw a ball the same ever again.\n\nI called the St. Louis Cardinals and told them I was retiring.\n\n_Retirement at 22 years old, not too bad, huh?_\n\n## Fast-forward to today\n\nI currently work at Vercel as a Content Engineer where I get to write tons of cool stuff on our blog. You'll also find me in some of our videos and other content. I love helping folks out with Next.js, Turborepo, and contributing to making the Web community grow stronger, together, every day.\n\nLet's build the Web. Faster.\n\n_Okay, I officially have a blog now? Nice._",

    "summary": "My thoughts on Vercel after a year of work",
    "content": "I had my \"Vercelaversary\" this past week and I wanted to take a moment to reflect (and share, in case anyone else finds it interesting).\n\nLet's take a look at my first year at Vercel.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nI want to be clear up front that this is not an \"ALL HAIL TRIANGLE\" post ([although I do think the meme is hilarious](https://twitter.com/anthonysheww/status/1664339106510569472)). I'm deeply curious and suspicious of the things I associate myself with by nature. I don't think Vercel is perfect or untouchable, same as anything else.\n\nI'm more than happy to rock the boat or voice my dissent if I think we're doing something wrong, no matter who or where the directive came from. A lot of the time, I find out I'm wrong, anyway, and learn something new.\n\nI'd also be more than happy to leave and go back to running my own business if I felt like we weren't working for the benefit of the Web and its' citizens. I choose to work at Vercel because I believe in the mission to build a better Web. My and Vercel's vision of that tend to line up pretty closely.\n\nToday, **I'm thankful** because my experience has matched my expectations so far. Can that change in the future? Sure! But, today, I'm revelling in the good vibes so I want to jot some things down.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's go!\n\n## How I got here\n\nBefore Vercel, [I ran my own small agency while I played professional baseball](/blog/my-developer-story). I had never worked in tech or held a \"real job.\"\n\nAt the time, I was coming back from what turned out to be a career-ending injury. One day, I happened to run into [Lee's blog post about DevRel at Vercel](https://leerob.io/blog/devrel-at-vercel). I followed the call-to-action at the bottom for folks who were interested in Vercel DevRel.\n\nI laughed as I hit send on the email. I wasn't even looking for a job at the time. I'd been a Vercel user for a few years and liked the product. But I'd seen the recent hires: this company was picking up all-stars. But, somehow, I'm writing this post today.\n\nMy job hunt added up to:\n\n- 0 intent (at least to start)\n- 0 formal job applications\n- 0 formal resumes\n- 1 three-paragraph email\n- 1 take-home writing assignment\n- 3 interviews\n\nSuddenly, I was working at a company I thought had something to do with the future of the internet.\n\n## I'm spoiled and I know it\n\nI'm perfectly aware of the lengthy, grueling job hunts that some folks are on these days and I feel for them. I've had folks ask me \"So, how did **you** get a job at Vercel?\" and...well, I don't have a great answer.\n\n### Spoiled but not \"spoiled rotten\"\n\nI wish I could make myself more useful to the community in the \"how to get a job\" conversation but I honestly don't believe it's my place. There are people with a lot of experience in this area so I'll defer to them.\n\nThe only way I think I can help that conversation is by doing the best I can with the opportunity I've been given. If you want to see my work, [read some articles on the Vercel Engineering Blog](https://vercel.com/blog/category/engineering); I either write or edit most of those. I do a bunch of other stuff but the articles on our blog are what you'll be able to find publically attributed to me.\n\n### I love my work\n\nLike I mentioned, I get to work on something I care deeply about - and I realize not everyone can say that.\n\nAgain, the only way I can think of bringing fairness to the lengthy-job-hunt folks is to do the best I can. Luckily, if I do that at Vercel, I can hopefully make a big impact on other developers and improve their work and personal lives.\n\n### The people around me are amazing\n\nI'm also spoiled when it comes to **who** I get to work with. Due to the unique needs of my current position, I'd estimate I've worked with or talked to ~150 of our 400 people, whether in Slack or in-person.\n\nInterestingly, I haven't met someone at Vercel that I can't get along with.\n\nYes, I'm serious. No, I'm not exaggerating. And, no, I don't have a great explanation for it. I just know it is what it is. 😁\n\nIn addition to being great to be around, our people are also so, so skillful. The collective breadth and depth of engineering knowledge at Vercel is remarkable and stands out in my mind - but the same goes for the folks in our other departments that I've interacted with.\n\n## Making the most of it by learning _everything_\n\nLike I said, I do what I can to show up and show out every day - but I also make a big point out of absorbing everything I can from the people around me. Here are a few of the many things I've learned.\n\n### I need to be 90% of myself\n\nI've never been apologetic about being completely myself. However, when I'm working with other people, I need to be courteous and respectful such that everyone has a levelset to operate inside of.\n\nAn example from my personality that I'll use is that I'm _**really**_ informal. Like \"show up to your black-tie wedding in swim trunks and flip flops\" informal. But my extreme informality can hurt my ability to work with other people when I use it in the wrong context.\n\nI'm from Southern California, and I surf, so my natural instinct is to call everyone \"dude.\" My grandma is \"dude\" and my dog is \"dude.\" For me, \"dude\" has no age, gender, race, nothing; _everyone_ that I like is dude.\n\nLike I said, my only job experience was playing sports. When you play sports, you mess around a lot to stay loose while you compete. But that's a different stage in a different environment with different needs to create teamwork. There are some things that certainly carry over ([for instance, thing I described in my React Miami talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_CHo6A0bAs)).\n\nI quickly recognized that I needed to switch it up a little bit for my new context. Don't get me wrong, though; I'm still me. This past week, I dropped this elite edit to tell [Evil Rabbit](https://twitter.com/evilrabbit_) that I think he's the GOAT (because he is).\n\n<Img\n  src=\"/images/blog/evil-rabbit-goat.png\"\n  alt=\"A picture of a goat that I photoshopped Evil Rabbit's logo onto.\"\n  width={3000}\n  height={2400}\n/>\n\n_Shoutout to [GrahamTheDev](https://twitter.com/GrahamTheDev) for the \"90% of yourself\" expression. Great turn of phrase so I'm borrowing it._ 😁\n\n### I need to use social media\n\nI've never used social media much and I still keep my usage quite low. But, for professional reasons, I've adapted to using social media for amplifying things that I'm interested in.\n\nI'm finding that, luckily, the very thing I'm interested in (helping developers make the Web better) has viral potential. Some of my best tweets ([1](https://twitter.com/anthonysheww/status/1583479736231030784), [2](https://twitter.com/anthonysheww/status/1658851868993540096), [3](https://twitter.com/anthonysheww/status/1644719245690048513)) in my young \"Twitter career\" have been things that help people.\n\nI guess I should do plugs at this point, right?\n\n- [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/shew.dev)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anthonysheww)\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwfYq8O-1QtU1TlWsJVGRBg)\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/anthonyshew)\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/JMHERJGRkH)\n\n### Next.js is crazy powerful\n\nI've been \"the Next.js person\" amongst my friends even before I started working at Vercel; I usually knew the answer to their questions. But, **wow**, Next.js is capable of so much more than I realized.\n\nI've been enjoying continuing to learn new Pages Router tricks and picking up the new patterns of the App Router.\n\n### Enterprise is a world I had no idea about\n\nLike I said, I've never held a \"real\" job, including as a developer, so I didn't know about the seriousness of the stacks that some of you deal with. I only ever made one site for a client using a painful stack. After that, I specifically opted out of any contract that used legacy technologies. I had the luxury of making choices for my mental health so I did.\n\nAt Vercel, I get to talk to and help developers from one-person startups to Fortune 100s. The tech talked about on Twitter and \"the thing you try to build at work\" are often different universes.\n\nI've learned and will continue to learn more about enterprise use cases to try to help more developers. One recent example was helping an enterprise customer with their Turborepo where we cut their build times by ~80% for most builds! The developer pain that alleviated meant so much to their team and I'm so proud to have had a hand in that.\n\n## Going forward\n\nLooking to the future, I'm excited for what's next.\n\nIn particular, I've been enjoying my time doing interim Turborepo DevRel duties while we don't have a full-time person on board. In my current role, I'm content-focused with a heavy emphasis on writing - but I think I'm really starting to fall in love with the idea of being a true DevRel.\n\nMy favorite days are the ones where I get to:\n\n- answer questions in the Turborepo Discord\n- write docs\n- make a video\n- help a Vercel customer with their setup on a support call\n- help someone with their pipeline on Twitter\n- support our salesfolks on another sales call\n- and finish the day with a little bit of API design discussion\n\nTime will tell what the future holds! But, today, I'm feeling grateful.\n\nThanks for reading.",
